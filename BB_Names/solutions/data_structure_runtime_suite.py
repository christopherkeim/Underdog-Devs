"""
This script tests the runtimes of different data structures in Python using two 
datasets: the baby_names_2020_short.txt dataset and the sowpods.txt dataset.

For all tests, the baby_names_2020_short.txt dataset will be loaded into 
memory as a list[str] and this data structure will be held CONSTANT across tests.

THE DATA STRUCTURE USED TO HOLD THE SOWPODS.TXT FILE WILL BE VARIED.

The code to implement our search algorithm in search_reverse_matches() will be
held CONSTANT as well - we are measuring how this search algorithm's runtime
varies as a function of the data structure it is searching through.

The Data Structures measured here are (sowpods.txt):

- tuple
- list
- dict
- set
- frozenset
- deque
- np.ndarray
